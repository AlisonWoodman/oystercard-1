#1) Write test for after touch in, card has variable 'entry_station'
#2) Make an entry station double in tests (returns itself when intialised)
#3) Make it pass by altering touch_in method
#4) Make existing tests pass again (the ones that were using touch_in)
#5) Make a test to check that entry_station is set to nil after touch_out is called
#6) Make test pass
#7) Make test to check in_journey? method
#8) Remove in_journey variable and make tests point to this
